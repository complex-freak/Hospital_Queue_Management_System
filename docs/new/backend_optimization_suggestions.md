# Backend Optimization Suggestions

## 1. Database Optimizations

- **Implement database connection pooling limits**: The current `database.py` doesn't specify max connections. Add `pool_size` and `max_overflow` parameters to prevent database connection exhaustion.

```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    settings.DATABASE_URL,
    echo=settings.ENVIRONMENT == "development",
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_size=20,        # Add this
    max_overflow=10      # Add this
)
```

- **Add database query timing metrics**: Implement middleware to track slow-performing queries and optimize them.

## 2. Authentication & Security

- **JWT token expiration**: The current expiration is set to 8 days in `config.py`, which is quite long for security. Consider reducing to 1-2 days and implementing refresh tokens.

- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

## 3. Caching

- **Add Redis caching**: For frequently accessed data like queue status and patient information. This would reduce database load significantly.

```python
# Example Redis caching implementation
async def get_queue_statistics_cached(db, date, doctor_id):
    cache_key = f"queue_stats:{date}:{doctor_id}"
    # Try to get from cache first
    cached = await redis.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    # If not in cache, get from database
    stats = await QueueService.get_queue_statistics(db, date, doctor_id)
    # Cache result for 5 minutes
    await redis.set(cache_key, json.dumps(stats), ex=300)
    return stats
```

## 4. Notification Service

- **Batch processing**: The current implementation sends notifications individually. Implement batching for SMS/push notifications when multiple patients need to be notified simultaneously.

- **Retry mechanisms**: Add robust retry logic for failed notifications with exponential backoff.

## 5. Queue Service Optimizations

- **Optimize priority calculation**: The current calculation method in `queue_service.py` is run for each queue entry. Consider caching common calculations.

- **Database indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on frequently queried fields:
  - `Queue.status` and `Queue.created_at` 
  - `Patient.phone_number`
  - `Appointment.patient_id` and `Appointment.doctor_id`

## 6. Error Handling

- **Structured error responses**: Implement a consistent error response format across all endpoints.

- **Global exception logging**: Enhance the current exception handler to log to file/external service for monitoring.

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

- **Add API metrics**: Add instrumentation to track API response times, error rates, and request volumes.

- **Health check enhancement**: Expand the health check to include database connectivity and other service dependencies.

## 8. Code Structure

- **Service dependency injection**: Switch to dependency injection for services instead of using static methods. This would make unit testing easier.

- **Environment-specific settings**: Allow more configuration options based on environment (dev/test/prod).

## 9. Performance

- **Pagination for large result sets**: Ensure all endpoints that return lists implement proper pagination.

- **Asynchronous background tasks**: Move more time-consuming operations to background tasks.
