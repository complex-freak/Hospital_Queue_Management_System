# ðŸš€ Full Implementation Plan for Intelligent Queue Management System

This plan breaks down all key tasks per phase, according to the finalized backend design.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Requirements Finalization & Setup

- Confirm functional & non-functional requirements with stakeholders.
- Define user stories for:
  - Patients
  - Doctors
  - Receptionists
  - Admins
- Create API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Setup project repositories & branch strategy (Git).
- Prepare `.env` for environment variables (JWT, DB, Twilio).

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Database Design & Setup

- Finalize ERD with all entities and relationships.
- Create PostgreSQL schema with UUIDs, constraints, indexes.
- Setup local & staging DB instances.
- Implement DB migrations using Alembic.

---

## âœ… Phase 3: Backend Core Development

- Scaffold FastAPI project structure.
- Implement models using SQLAlchemy ORM (async).
- Create Pydantic schemas for input/output validation.
- Implement security module:
  - JWT OAuth2
  - Bcrypt password hashing
  - RBAC dependency
- Setup database session & connection pooling.

---

## âœ… Phase 4: User Management Module

- **Patients:**
  - Register with phone number & password.
  - Login endpoint.
  - Profile CRUD (update demographic info).
- **Admins:**
  - Create/manage staff, doctors, other admins.
  - Enforce unique username/phone number.
- Implement audit logging with `BackgroundTasks`.

---

## âœ… Phase 5: Queue & Appointment Module

- Implement appointment booking API.
- Develop queue assignment logic:
  - FIFO with urgency override.
  - Priority score calculation.
- Create endpoints for:
  - View queue status (patient).
  - Manage queue (staff).
  - View & mark served (doctor).
- Build offline sync endpoint for cached updates.

---

## âœ… Phase 6: Notification Module

- Integrate Twilio for SMS.
- Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
- Implement background notification tasks using FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`:
  - Send booking confirmation.
  - Notify before turn (~15 min remaining).
  - Notify when itâ€™s the patientâ€™s turn.
- Store all notifications in DB log.

---

## âœ… Phase 7: Web Dashboards

- **Receptionist Dashboard (React.js):**
  - Quick patient registration form.
  - Queue manager view with reorder/priority override.
- **Doctor Dashboard (React.js):**
  - Prioritized patient list.
  - Patient info view.
  - Mark as served.
- **Admin Dashboard (React.js):**
  - User management.
  - System usage analytics.

(Note: Frontend development can run in parallel with API development using mocked endpoints.)

---

## âœ… Phase 8: Offline Sync & Caching

- Mobile app:
  - Use AsyncStorage/SQLite for local queue & profile.
  - Implement auto-sync on reconnect.
- Receptionist web:
  - Use IndexedDB + Service Workers.
  - Auto-retry failed requests.
- Implement server-side conflict resolution logic.

---

## âœ… Phase 9: Testing & Quality Assurance

- Unit tests for API endpoints using Pytest.
- Integration tests for DB interactions.
- End-to-end tests for mobile & web flows.
- Security testing: JWT, RBAC, HTTPS.
- Load test queue performance (simulate high patient flow).
- Test offline sync scenarios.

---

## âœ… Phase 10: Deployment & Monitoring

- Containerize API using Docker.
- Setup CI/CD pipeline for auto-deploy on merge.
- Deploy to cloud platform (e.g., Render, DigitalOcean).
- Apply HTTPS certificates.
- Enable logging & monitoring with Sentry and DB logs.
- Setup backup & restore for PostgreSQL.

---

## âœ… Phase 11: User Training & Rollout

- Prepare user manuals for patients, staff, doctors.
- Train hospital staff on using the system.
- Run pilot rollout with a small group.
- Gather feedback, fix bugs, and iterate.

---

## âœ… Phase 12: Documentation & Handover

- Deliver complete API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Deliver ERD, system architecture diagrams.
- Deliver admin guides & support instructions.
- Final project report & lessons learned.
