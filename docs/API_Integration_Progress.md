# API Integration Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of integrating the frontend web application with the backend API, following the updated implementation plan. The implementation is structured in clear phases, with each phase outlining the specific endpoints, schema/model updates, and removals required for full alignment between frontend and backend. **Each phase specifies whether the work is to be done in the backend, frontend web-app, or both.**

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Authentication & User Management (Backend & Frontend)
**Status: COMPLETE**

After analyzing the current implementation, we found that the authentication system is already well-implemented and aligned between frontend and backend.

**Backend Implementation:**
- All required authentication endpoints are implemented:
  - `/staff/login`, `/doctor/login`, `/admin/login`
  - `/staff/me`, `/doctor/me`, `/admin/me`
  - `/staff/logout`, `/doctor/logout`, `/admin/logout`
- JWT implementation is robust with proper token creation, verification, and password hashing
- Role-based access control is properly implemented in the dependencies.py file

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Authentication service files correctly interact with the backend endpoints
- Token management, storage, and refresh logic is properly implemented
- Context providers for authentication state are in place
- Role-based routing and protected routes are implemented

**No Changes Required:** The authentication system is already well-aligned between frontend and backend, with proper data transformation and error handling.

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Patient & Queue Management (Backend & Frontend)
**Status: COMPLETE**

**Backend Implementation:**
- All required patient management endpoints were already implemented:
  - `/staff/patients` (GET) - For retrieving all patients
  - `/staff/patients/register` (POST) - For registering new patients
  - `/staff/patients/drafts` (POST) - For saving draft registrations
  - `/staff/patients/drafts/{id}` (GET) - For retrieving draft registrations
  - `/staff/appointments/{id}/priority` (PATCH) - For updating appointment priority
  - `/staff/appointments/{id}/cancel` (POST) - For cancelling appointments
- All required queue management endpoints were already implemented or have been added:
  - `/staff/queue` (GET) - For retrieving the current queue
  - `/staff/appointments` (GET, POST) - For managing appointments

**Changes Made:**
- Added the `/staff/queue/stats` endpoint to provide queue statistics for the frontend

**Notes:**
- The backend already had a robust implementation of patient and queue management
- The frontend service was already well-aligned with the backend API structure
- Data transformation logic handles the conversion between snake_case (backend) and camelCase (frontend)

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Doctor service is now fully implemented with all required functionality:
  - Doctor profile and status management
  - Patient notes creation and retrieval
  - Note history tracking
  - Consultation feedback submission and retrieval
- Data transformers have been updated to handle all new models and fields:
