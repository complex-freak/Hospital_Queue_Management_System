# Hospital App Mobile API Integration Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of integrating the mobile app with the backend API according to the integration plan outlined in `Mobile_API_Integration_Plan.md`.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
- ✅ Created API service structure with HttpClient implementation
- ✅ Implemented AuthService with:
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Profile retrieval
  - Profile updates
  - Profile completion
- ✅ Connected AuthContext to use AuthService for authentication operations
- ✅ Updated navigation to handle authentication states:
  - Unauthenticated users -> Login/Register screens
  - Authenticated users with incomplete profiles -> Onboarding screen
  - Fully authenticated users -> Main app screens
- ✅ Enhanced OnboardingScreen to use real API endpoints

### Phase 2: Queue & Appointments
- ✅ Implemented AppointmentService with:
  - Create appointment
  - Get queue status
  - Get appointments list
  - Get appointment details
  - Update appointment
  - Cancel appointment
- ✅ Added data transformation functions to convert between backend and frontend data formats

### Phase 3: Notifications
- ✅ Created NotificationService structure with:
  - Get notifications
  - Mark notification as read
  - Register device token
- ✅ Implemented NotificationsContext for state management
- ✅ Updated API path configuration to match actual backend endpoints

### Phase 4: Settings & Offline Support
- ✅ Created SettingsService structure with:
  - Get settings
  - Update settings
- ✅ Implemented offline support:
  - ConnectivityService for monitoring network status
  - SyncService for queuing and processing offline actions
  - Enhanced HttpClient with offline-aware methods
  - NetworkStatusBar component to display connectivity status
- ✅ Updated appointment service to work in offline mode
- ✅ Updated API path configuration to match actual backend endpoints

## API Endpoint Mapping Status

| Frontend Path | Backend Endpoint | Status |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| `/api/v1/patient/register` | `/api/v1/patient/register` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/login` | `/api/v1/patient/login` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/profile` | `/api/v1/patient/profile` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/complete-profile` | `/api/v1/patient/profile` (PUT) | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/appointments` | `/api/v1/patient/appointments` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/queue-status` | `/api/v1/patient/queue-status` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/notifications` | `/api/v1/patient/notifications` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/notifications/{id}/read` | `/api/v1/patient/notifications/{notification_id}/read` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/device-token` | `/api/v1/patient/device-token` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/settings` | `/api/v1/patient/settings` | ✅ Working |

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Enhancements:**
   - Implement conflict resolution for offline changes
   - Add error recovery mechanisms for failed sync attempts
   - Implement background synchronization
   - Create a sync status dashboard for users

2. **Testing:**
   - Create comprehensive integration tests for online and offline flows
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test cross-device synchronization
   - Perform end-to-end testing with real backend

3. **Deployment:**
   - Setup production environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Prepare for app store submission

## Known Issues

1. No conflict resolution mechanism for offline changes that conflict with server changes
2. Network transitions need more thorough testing in different scenarios
3. Need to implement refresh token mechanism for better authentication persistence
