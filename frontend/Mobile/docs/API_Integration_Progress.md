# Hospital App Mobile API Integration Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of integrating the mobile app with the backend API according to the integration plan outlined in `Mobile_API_Integration_Plan.md`.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 4: Offline Support

- ✅ Implemented ConnectivityService to monitor network status
- ✅ Created offline queue system in SyncService
- ✅ Added offline support for:
  - Creating appointments
  - Updating appointments
  - Cancelling appointments
- ✅ Implemented NetworkStatusBar component to display connectivity status
- ✅ Added four-step sync workflow:
  1. Queue operations while offline
  2. Detect when back online
  3. Process queued operations in order
  4. Update local data after sync
- ✅ Complete offline caching for appointment data
- ✅ Implement conflict resolution for sync operations
- ✅ Add data versioning for sync operations

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 5: Push Notifications

- ⬜ Implement Expo push notification setup
- ⬜ Register device token with backend
- ⬜ Handle incoming push notifications
- ⬜ Update app badge count
- ⬜ Add notification permission handling

## Known Issues

1. Queue status API endpoint doesn't provide real-time updates yet
2. Some appointment fields might be missing when creating offline
3. Network detection can be flaky on certain Android devices

## Next Steps

1. Implement push notifications
3. Add comprehensive error handling for all API operations
4. Enhance data caching and persistence strategies

## API Endpoint Mapping Status

| Frontend Path                               | Backend Endpoint                                         | Status     |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `/api/v1/patient/register`                | `/api/v1/patient/register`                             | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/login`                   | `/api/v1/patient/login`                                | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/profile`                 | `/api/v1/patient/profile`                              | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/complete-profile`        | `/api/v1/patient/profile` (PUT)                        | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/appointments`            | `/api/v1/patient/appointments`                         | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/queue-status`            | `/api/v1/patient/queue-status`                         | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/notifications`           | `/api/v1/patient/notifications`                        | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/notifications/{id}/read` | `/api/v1/patient/notifications/{notification_id}/read` | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/device-token`            | `/api/v1/patient/device-token`                         | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/patient/settings`                | `/api/v1/patient/settings`                             | ✅ Working |

## Offline Support Details

### Implementation Highlights:

- ✅ ConnectivityService monitors network status using NetInfo
- ✅ SyncService maintains a queue of pending actions in AsyncStorage
- ✅ Automatic sync attempts when coming back online
- ✅ Visual feedback to users about offline status
- ✅ Prioritized user operations with offline queuing

### Sync Workflow:

1. Check network status before API requests
2. Queue operations when offline
3. Automatically attempt sync when connection is restored
4. Retry failed sync operations with exponential backoff

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Enhancements:**

   - Implement conflict resolution for offline changes
   - Add error recovery mechanisms for failed sync attempts
   - Implement background synchronization
   - Create a sync status dashboard for users
2. **Testing:**

   - Create comprehensive integration tests for online and offline flows
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test cross-device synchronization
   - Perform end-to-end testing with real backend
3. **Deployment:**

   - Setup production environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Prepare for app store submission

## Known Issues

1. No conflict resolution mechanism for offline changes that conflict with server changes
2. Network transitions need more thorough testing in different scenarios
3. Need to implement refresh token mechanism for better authentication persistence
4. Large offline queues may need optimization for performance
