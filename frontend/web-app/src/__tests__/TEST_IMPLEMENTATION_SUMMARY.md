# Hospital Queuing System - Test Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing implementation completed for the Hospital Queuing System web application. The implementation focuses on establishing a robust testing foundation that covers critical components and services of the application.

## Implemented Tests

### Unit Tests

#### Service Tests
1. **NotificationService Tests** (`notificationService.test.ts`)
   - Tests for creating, adding, and managing notifications
   - Tests for subscription/unsubscription functionality
   - Tests for notification read status management

2. **QueueService Tests** (`queueService.test.ts`)
   - Tests for queue retrieval and manipulation 
   - Tests for patient addition, removal, and status updates
   - Tests for queue reordering functionality

3. **ConnectivityService Tests** (`connectivityService.test.ts`)
   - Tests for online/offline status detection
   - Tests for subscription to connectivity changes
   - Tests for event handler registration

4. **IndexedDBService Tests** (`indexedDBService.test.ts`)
   - Tests for database operations (get, save, update)
   - Tests for offline data persistence
   - Tests for queue data management

#### Component Tests
1. **PatientForm Tests** (`PatientForm.test.tsx`)
   - Tests for form rendering and field validation
   - Tests for form submission with various data inputs
   - Tests for form reset and error state handling

2. **QueueMonitor Tests** (`QueueMonitor.test.tsx`)
   - Tests for queue display and filtering
   - Tests for patient status updates
   - Tests for UI interactions

#### Hook Tests
1. **useAuth Tests** (`useAuth.test.tsx`)
   - Tests for authentication state management
   - Tests for login/logout functionality
   - Tests for role-based access control

### Integration Tests

1. **Patient Registration to Doctor Workflow** (`patientWorkflow.test.tsx`)
   - End-to-end test of patient registration through doctor assignment
   - Tests for queue updates reflecting patient status changes
   - Tests for drag-and-drop queue reordering functionality

## Test Configuration

We've configured Jest with:

1. **Specific Coverage Thresholds**:
   - Global: 50% (baseline minimum)
   - Services: 80%
   - Hooks: 80% 
   - Contexts: 70%

2. **Custom Test Commands**:
   - `npm test`: Run all tests
   - `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
   - `npm run test:coverage`: Generate coverage reports
   - `npm run test:unit`: Run only unit tests
   - `npm run test:integration`: Run only integration tests
   - `npm run test:ci`: Run tests in CI environment

## Mocking Strategy

We implemented several mocking strategies:

1. **Service Mocks**: 
   - IndexedDBService mock for database operations
   - NotificationService mock for notification handling
   - QueueService mock for queue operations

2. **React Context Mocks**:
   - AuthContext for authentication state
   - QueueContext for queue data management
   - NotificationContext for notification state

3. **React Router Mocks**:
   - Mock navigation functions for testing routing behavior

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Component Coverage**:
   - Add tests for all dashboard components
   - Add tests for authentication forms
   - Add tests for notification components

2. **Add E2E Tests**:
   - Consider adding Cypress for complete end-to-end workflows

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Add tests for queue performance with large datasets
   - Test offline/online sync performance

4. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Expand error scenario testing for network failures
   - Test edge cases in data processing
