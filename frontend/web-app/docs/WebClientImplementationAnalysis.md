- User management system
- Analytics with charts and visualizations
- Queue configuration tools
- System settings management
- Reporting tools

### 8. Offline Support & Connectivity
✅ **Completed**:
- Online/offline detection with ConnectivityService
- IndexedDB integration for offline data storage
- Pending actions queue for offline operations
- Background sync when connection is restored
- Offline action notifications

### 9. Notification System
✅ **Completed**:
- Comprehensive notification service
- Toast notifications for system events
- Browser notifications (with permission handling)
- Notification history and management
- Event-specific notifications (wait time alerts, priority changes, etc.)

## Missing Components and Features

### 1. API Integration
⏳ **To Be Implemented**:
- Complete real API integration for some features
- Enhance error handling for specific API failures
- Add more comprehensive loading states

### 2. Testing
⏳ **To Be Implemented**:
- Complete unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for key workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Comprehensive offline functionality testing

### 3. Performance & Accessibility
⏳ **To Be Implemented**:
- Code splitting for large admin features
- Performance optimizations for data-heavy views
- Comprehensive accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsiveness enhancements

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Complete API Integration (Current Phase)
1. Replace remaining mock API calls with real endpoints
2. Add better error handling for API failures
3. Implement comprehensive loading states
4. Add data validation for form submissions

### Phase 2: Testing Enhancement
1. Write unit tests for all major components
2. Implement integration tests for critical flows
3. Set up E2E testing infrastructure
4. Test offline to online transitions thoroughly

### Phase 3: Performance & Accessibility
1. Implement code splitting for large pages
2. Add lazy loading for non-critical components
3. Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes
4. Improve mobile responsiveness

### Phase 4: Final Polish
1. Add analytics tracking
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Conduct user testing
4. Address final bugs and UX issues

## Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

1. Add proper error boundaries throughout the application
2. Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes)
3. Enhance mobile responsiveness for complex views
4. Optimize bundle size for admin features
5. Add more comprehensive form validation

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a robust foundation for the Hospital Queuing System. The unified feature-based architecture with role-specific modules has been successfully implemented, creating a maintainable and scalable application. Most of the core features have been implemented across all user roles, with particular strengths in:

1. Role-based feature organization
2. Comprehensive offline support
3. Well-designed notification system
4. Drag-and-drop queue management
5. Connectivity monitoring and synchronization

To finalize Step 4, focus should be on:
1. Completing the real API integration
2. Implementing comprehensive testing
3. Optimizing performance and accessibility
4. Adding final polish and user experience improvements

This implementation will require an estimated 1-2 weeks of development time to complete the remaining features and testing requirements.
