## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete real API integration for remaining features (Doctor and Admin endpoints)
2. Add comprehensive form validation
3. Write additional unit tests for completed components
4. Improve error handling for API failures
5. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for Patient Management API

### Medium-Term Tasks (3-4 Weeks)
1. Add additional connectivity features
2. Enhance notification system with browser push notifications
3. Write integration tests for critical flows

### Long-Term Tasks (5-8 Weeks)
1. Implement E2E testing
2. Optimize for performance
3. Enhance accessibility
4. Add analytics tracking

## Issues & Blockers

| Issue | Description | Priority | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
